This tool is currently under development. Right now it will just scrap a website and will provide information like:

* Urls related to main domain and subdomains.
* Mails.
* Tel Numbers.



## Usage

#### Modules
First of all make sure that appropriate modules are installed:

```
  pip install bs4
```
```
  pip install requests
```


#### Run:
To run program goto installed directory and rull the following command:
```
  python main.py
```
Enter url to scrap. e.g. https://www.example.com

## Appendix

Other than scraping, this software does not currently support any other functions. Multiprocessing will be added soon to speed up programs.
